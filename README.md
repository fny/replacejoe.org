# Replace Joe Biden ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

This is a parody of [JoeBiden.com](https://joebiden.com) with the intent of encouraging visitors to voice their disatisfaction and encourage Biden to step down through petitions and messages to government officials.

While JoeBiden.com is copyrighted, a [parody](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/parody) such as this is permitted under fair use. If you intend to fork this code for your own purposes, be ware of this limitation.

If you're interested in helping beyond spreading the word (which is more important than submitting code, in my opinion) I am open to pull requests that:

 - Fixes bugs
 - Fixes spelling and grammar
 - Fixes inaccuracies
 - Cleans up the mess from calling wget to pull joebiden.com
 - Cleans up the mess of code I wrote to get this working quickly
 - Optimizes load times

I am hesistant to update content and add new features, but if you've got a killer suggestion by all means ask, and I'll give you the go ahead.

Note I will not be doing any further significant work to push this forward. It's on you to make the appropriate PR.
